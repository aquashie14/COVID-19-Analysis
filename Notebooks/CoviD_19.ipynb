    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Business Context\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic remains one of the most significant public health challenges in Ghana’s modern history. Since the first confirmed case in March 2020, the Ghana Health Service (GHS), Ministry of Information, and Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) have provided regular updates on confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across all regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These updates provided a valuable data foundation for understanding the spread, peak periods, and recovery dynamics of the disease. However, raw figures alone cannot reveal deeper insights into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporal and regional trends in infections and recoveries,\n",
    "- Effectiveness of interventions such as lockdowns, vaccination drives, and testing campaigns, and\n",
    "- Data-driven lessons for future epidemic preparedness.\n",
    "Data analytics provides a powerful approach for transforming these daily records into actionable knowledge that can guide public health decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and improve national crisis response systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Business Problem\n",
    "Although Ghana collected rich COVID-19 data, decision-makers lacked detailed analytical dashboards and trend models to help:\n",
    "- Identify periods of rapid spread or containment,\n",
    "- Detect patterns in recoveries and deaths,\n",
    "- Evaluate the timing and impact of government interventions, and\n",
    "- Provide evidence-based recommendations for future response strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the core business problem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "How can use data analysis to uncover meaningful insights from Ghana’s COVID-19 records to evaluate patterns, inform policy, and strengthen health system preparedness?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Business Objectives\n",
    "Main Objective:\n",
    "- To analyze and visualize Ghana’s COVID-19 dataset to uncover temporal trends, relationships, and policy-relevant insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Objectives:\n",
    "- Identify temporal patterns (growth, decline, and peaks) in active, recovered, and death cases.\n",
    "- Examine relationships among key indicators such as total cases, recoveries, and deaths.\n",
    "- Assess how government interventions may have influenced trends.\n",
    "- Build an interactive dashboard for policymakers to explore insights easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 Business Questions\n",
    "1. How did active and cumulative COVID-19 cases evolve over time in Ghana?\n",
    "2. When did Ghana experience the major peaks of the pandemic, and what interventions were implemented?\n",
    "3. How do recovery and death trends compare across the different phases of the pandemic?\n",
    "4. What patterns emerge when we compare new cases to testing and active case numbers?\n",
    "5. What actionable lessons can be drawn to inform future public health response strategies?\n",
